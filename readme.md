## Change

1. Add shortcut keys.

2. Pack CheatEngine table into executable file.

## Usage

Download [release](https://github.com/magicwenli/NieR-Freecam/releases/tag/A2)

- Ctrl+F - Toggle freecam
  - Left stick - Zoom in and out
  - Right stick - Move camera position
  - L2 does your current movement slow
  - R2 does you current movement fast

- Ctrl+T - Toggle time stop

## For gamers who do not use controller

Camera posture adjustment does not support a keyboard. you may need a virtual controller and mapping joysticks to keyboard.

Download and install [Virtual Controller](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoy-controller/)

Add an virtual IO device(vXbox), reboot.

Load the [configuration file](https://github.com/magicwenli/NieR-Freecam/blob/master/Virtual%20Controller/VC_NieR_Conf.vcd), and run.

### Key mapping

- L2 - [
- R2 - ]
- Left stick - WASD
- Right stick - Arrow keys

### Bugs

The virtual controller conflicts with the keyboard jump. It is better to only turn on the virtual controller when you need to adjust the camera.
